- Landing page with an interactive menu to select sections of the game (Instructions, Contact Form, Scores and Play button).
- Allow a user to see their previous results.
- Fully functional contact form with emailJS that will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
- A 404 error page that is styled and allows navigation back to the main page.
- Clear favicon that shows the site logo.

## Design of Site

### Initial idea
The initial design idea of the site is to create a simple memory card flipping game for a user to have fun with. The focus of the site is to be on the game and so I will create a simple hosting site which does not distract from the purpose. To keep within the theme of the card flipping all options on the scrolling webpage will be contained within card flipping containers to allow the interactivity to extend beyond the game. The site will be designed to be accessible to both children and adults.

### Wireframes

To create the wireframes I used [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/). I found this service quite useful over other wireframing services as it allowed a much deeper design experience compared to similar services which allowed me to create a clear design scheme to follow for the project.

The Mobile site was designed to be a vertically scrolling page as it is more consistent with how most would use that device (portrait-mode).

Below you will see the rough content of the menu card divs which is kept consistent across all of the device types and so will not be shown again.

For Desktop and Tablet, I felt there as the surface area of the screen is a little more akin to a square setting the menu cards out as a grid made more logistical sense in terms of using screen real estate. Therefore the design for both devices is similar.

The design for the Game pages are all quite similar regardless of the device. This was I wanted to keep the interactive experience of the website consistent regardless of the device. This would allow the same user to use a new device and have the same experience.

<details><summary>Desktop wireframe Game page</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Game.html_Desktop.png"></details><br>


### Site Layout

The site as designed will be composed of two pages which will be the home landing page and the game page:

* Home page

    This page will be composed of a banner at the top which will contain the logo for the site along with the navigation bar that will allow the user to access the other sections of the site without using the forward or back button on the browser. Below this in the main body of the page will be divs that behave like the flip cards in the game. Each of these divs will be relevent to a section of the website specifically; a div to play the game, a div to find out about the game, a div to see previous scores, a div to contact the website owner and a div to access social media (in an actual release this would connect to pages setup relevent to the website, at present they just connect to the social media home page).

* Game Page

    This page will have the same banner as the Home page to keep consistent across the site. Below the banner will be a section where the number of moves taken during the game and the time taken to complete the game will be tracked. Below that will be the section where the memory cards will be and arranged in a grid. 

### Colour Choices

Below you will see the main colours selected for this webpage, these were selected for both the logo and the divs as they were clear complementary colours and the pastel theme I felt made it more accessible for younger children which was the main target audience. This was backed up by the darker purple which contrasted with the divs quite effectively and was given a linear gradient as the solid fill looked too stark on the page. The text colour was selected to be a white as this would keep the page looking bright and vibrant.
