## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

- Landing page with an interactive menu to select sections of the game (Instructions, Contact Form, Scores and Play button).
- Allow a user to see their previous results.
- Fully functional contact form with emailJS that will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
- A 404 error page that is styled and allows navigation back to the main page.
- Clear favicon that shows the site logo.

## Design of Site

### Initial idea
The initial design idea of the site is to create a simple memory card flipping game for a user to have fun with. The focus of the site is to be on the game and so I will create a simple hosting site which does not distract from the purpose. To keep within the theme of the card flipping all options on the scrolling webpage will be contained within card flipping containers to allow the interactivity to extend beyond the game. The site will be designed to be accessible to both children and adults.

### Wireframes

To create the wireframes I used [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/). I found this service quite useful over other wireframing services as it allowed a much deeper design experience compared to similar services which allowed me to create a clear design scheme to follow for the project.

The Mobile site was designed to be a vertically scrolling page as it is more consistent with how most would use that device (portrait-mode).
<details><summary>Mobile wireframe Home page (Unclicked)</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Unclicked Mobile Home page.png"></details><br>

Below you will see the rough content of the menu card divs which is kept consistent across all of the device types and so will not be shown again.
<details><summary>Mobile wireframe Home page (Clicked)</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Unclicked Mobile Home page.png"></details><br>

For Desktop and Tablet, I felt there as the surface area of the screen is a little more akin to a square setting the menu cards out as a grid made more logistical sense in terms of using screen real estate. Therefore the design for both devices is similar.
<details><summary>Desktop and tablet wireframe Home page</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Index.html_Desktop.png"><img src="/workspace/Milestone_project_2/Docs/Wireframes/Index.html_Tablet.png"></details><br>


The design for the Game pages are all quite similar regardless of the device. This was I wanted to keep the interactive experience of the website consistent regardless of the device. This would allow the same user to use a new device and have the same experience.

<details><summary>Tablet wireframe Game page</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Game.html_Tablet.png"></details><br>

<details><summary>Desktop wireframe Game page</summary><img src="Docs/Wireframes/Game.html_Desktop.png"></details><br>


### Site Layout

The site as designed will be composed of two pages which will be the home landing page and the game page:

* Home page

    This page will be composed of a banner at the top which will contain the logo for the site along with the navigation bar that will allow the user to access the other sections of the site without using the forward or back button on the browser. Below this in the main body of the page will be divs that behave like the flip cards in the game. Each of these divs will be relevent to a section of the website specifically; a div to play the game, a div to find out about the game, a div to see previous scores, a div to contact the website owner and a div to access social media (in an actual release this would connect to pages setup relevent to the website, at present they just connect to the social media home page).

* Game Page

    This page will have the same banner as the Home page to keep consistent across the site. Below the banner will be a section where the number of moves taken during the game and the time taken to complete the game will be tracked. Below that will be the section where the memory cards will be and arranged in a grid. 

### Colour Choices

Below you will see the main colours selected for this webpage, these were selected for both the logo and the divs as they were clear complementary colours and the pastel theme I felt made it more accessible for younger children which was the main target audience. This was backed up by the darker purple which contrasted with the divs quite effectively and was given a linear gradient as the solid fill looked too stark on the page. The text colour was selected to be a white as this would keep the page looking bright and vibrant.

### Fonts

The font used for the site is the "Exo" font as this had quite a bold and easy to read style whilst also being curved, thus giving the website an approachable feel. I also provided "sans serif" as a backup as it also clear and legible though not as styled.
## Technologies Implemented

### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
### Tools

* Figma - Used to develop the wireframes and create the site logo.
* Favicon<span>.</span>io - Used to create favicon for site and generate files to implement.
* Adobe Cloud - Used to generate Gifs of site functions.
* Git and Github - Used for version control and hosting.
* Gitpod - Used as an IDE.
* Google Fonts - Used to generate custom fonts for the website. 
* Responsinator.com- Used to assess responsiveness across a large device array and orientations.
## Site Features

N.B. The site has gone through some revision. During the course of the project I fell quite ill and had to cut back on several features due to time crunch but still endeavoured to follow a minimal viable product approach. These changes will be detailed in the user stories testing section.
## Testing
    
### Validation

#### HTML Validation- W3C markup validation service was used to assess the validity of my HTML code.

### Performance and Accessibility

Google Lighthouse as part of the Chrom dev tools was used to assess performance and accessibility.

<details><summary>Game page Performance and Accessibility</summary><img src="Docs/Performance and accessibility/LightHouse_Score_Game_page.png"></details>The lower best practices score on the Game page is related to the images used for the flip cards. The aspect ratio needed to be changed from its original value to better fit the page. However care had been taken to ensure images are still legible and clear.<br>

## Bug Squashing

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
|---------|---------|
|On some safari devices the menu cards would not flip correctly, and the backface would disappear thus rendering the text invisible.| I was not able to completely erase this bug however I was able to eliminate the phenemenon that caused the text to disappear, it seems to be a known issue among safari's interaction with the back-face visibility property. The fix was found here: https://forum.blocsapp.com/t/css-backface-visibility-issue-solved/20229/6. Adding the webkit prefix to all properties relating to the flipping effect also did not work but once the Translate Z property was applied functionality was returned. What I beleieve happened was the front and back faces of the div occupied the same space on the z axis which once the backface-visibility property was applied hid both faces of the div. Unfortunately this seems to have removed the 3d flip effect however allowing both faces of the div to be visible and the fact this is an issue with only a small number of devices I believe this to be a successful fix for the current moment. UPDATE: Upon retesting the 3d effect appears to have been activated, not sure what caused the change but possibly related to the cache.
